We quantify the burdens of server computational cost in terms of time.
        |      CIFAR10    |
        | LeNet |   CNN   |
FedDHAD | 0.122 | 0.156   |
FedDH   | 0.086 | 0.042   |

The burdens of FedDH are up to 8.6%, which is quite small. 
In addition, the burdens of FedDHAD are up to 12.2%, which corresponds to higher accuracy, shorter time to achieve target accuracy, and smaller computation costs.
